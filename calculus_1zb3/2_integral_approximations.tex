    \section*{Integral Approximation}
    \begin{align*}
        S_m &= \sum_{n=1}^{m} a_n \\
        R_m &= \sum_{n=m+1}^{\infty} a_n \\
        S_\infty &= S_m + R_m \\
        S_\infty &\approx S_m + \int_{m}^{\infty} f(x) \ dx \\
        \int_{m+1}^{\infty} f(x) \ dx \le S&-S_m \le \int_{m}^{\infty} f(x) \ dx
    \end{align*}
    If $f(x)$ is positive continuous and monotonic decreasing then
    \begin{align*}
        \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \le S_m + \int_{m}^{\infty} f(x) \ dx
    \end{align*}

    \subsection*{Example}
    Approximate $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}$
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item using only the fourth partial sum.
        \item within an error of 0.03.
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{align*}
        S-S_4 = R_4 &\le \int_{4}^{\infty} 1/x^2 \ dx \\
        &\le \Big[-1/x\Big]_4^{\infty} \\
        &\le -\frac{1}{\infty} - -\frac{1}{4} \\
        S-S_4&\le \frac{1}{4}
    \end{align*}

    \begin{align*}
        S-S_m &\le 0.03 \\
        S-S_m \le \int_{m}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^2} \ dx &\le 0.03 \\
        \Big[-\frac{1}{x} \Big]_m^\infty &\le 0.03 \\
        \frac{1}{m} &\le 0.03 \\
        m &\ge \frac{1}{0.03} \\
        m &\ge 33.\bar{3}
    \end{align*}
    Since we are looking for the minimum possible approximation (that
    has to be a whole number), $m=34$.

    \section*{Alternating Series Approximation}
    An alternating series that has terms whose absolute value is  monotonic
    decreasing will oscillate between being greater than and being less than the
    convergent value.
    \[
        |S - S_m| = \Big|\sum_{n=m+1}^{\infty} (-1)^n b_n\Big| \le b_{m+1}
    \]
    For something like $b_n= \frac{1}{n^2}$, just using 5 terms will give only
    an error of $\frac{1}{5^2} = 0.04$. Since alternating series converge much
    faster, integral approximations not needed as often.
