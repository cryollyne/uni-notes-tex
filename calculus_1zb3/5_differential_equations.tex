    \maketitle
    An ordinary differential equations (ODE) is a type of differential equation
    (DE) that contain derivatives with respect to only a single independent
    variable. It is called ordinary because it only contains one independent
    variable. The order of an ODE the highest derivative in the differential
    equation. The solution for a differential equation is a function that
    satisfies the differential equation on some interval. The solution may or
    may not be unique. An autonomous differential equation is a differential
    equation that has no explicit terms containing the independent variable.

    \section*{Shape of Differential Equation Graphs}
    It is possible to determine properties of the shape of a differential
    equation by examining the equation.
    \subsection*{Example}
    \[
        y'=x(y-1)^2
    \]
    When this differential equation is evaluated at a point $(x,y)$, the
    solution to the differential equation passing through the point $(x,y)$ must
    be the slope found.

    \section*{Orthogonal trajectories}
    If $\frac{dy}{dx} = F(x,y)$, then the orthogonal trajectory is
    $\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{1}{F(x,y)}$

    \subsection*{Example}
    \begin{align*}
        y = ke^x \\
        y' = ke^x
    \end{align*}
    \begin{align*}
        y' &= -\frac{1}{ke^x} \\
        \frac{dy}{dx} &= -\frac{1}{y} \\
        y\ dy &= -dx \\
        \frac{1}{2} y^2 &= -x + c
    \end{align*}

    \subsection*{Example 2}
    \begin{align*}
        y = kx^2 \\
        y' = 2kx \\
        k = \frac{y}{x^2} \\
        y' = 2(\frac{y}{x^2})x \\
        y' = \frac{2y}{x}
    \end{align*}
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{dy}{dx} &= -\frac{1}{\frac{2y}{x}} \\
        \frac{dy}{dx} &= -\frac{x}{2y} \\
        2y\ dy &= -x\ dx \\
        y^2 &= -\frac{1}{2} x^2 + c \\
        x^2 + 2y^2 &= c
    \end{align*}


    \section*{Guessing a Solution}
    If a differential equation is simple, it may be possible to correctly guess
    a solution. The guess and check method is to guess a generic function and
    check if there are any parameters of a function that will satisfy the
    differential equation.
    \subsection*{Example}
    \[
        y'' - 3y' + 2y = 0
    \]
    Let $y = e^{mx}$
    \begin{align*}
        y &= e^{mx} \\
        y' &= me^{mx} \\
        y''  &= m^2e^{mx}
    \end{align*}
    \begin{align*}
        y'' - 3y' + 2y &= 0 \\
        m^2e^{mx} - 3me^{mx} + 2e^{mx} &= 0 \\
        (m^2 - 3m + 2)e^{mx} &= 0 \\
        (m^2 - 3m + 2) &= 0 \\
        (m-2)(m-1) &= 0 \\
        m &= 1,2 \\
        \therefore\ y&=e^{2x}, y=e^{x}
    \end{align*}

    \section*{Initial Value Problems}
    Initial value problems are differential equation problems that need to
    satisfy some initial conditions.

    \subsection*{Example}
    A Person is jumping off a high place. If $g=10$ m/s$^2$ how fast do they move
    at 2s if at time 0s, position is 10m and velocity is 0 m/s.
    \begin{align*}
        F_{net} &= -F_g \\
        ma &= -mg \\
        a &= -g \\
        x''(t) &= -10 \text{ m}/\text{s}^2 \\
        x'(0) &= 0 \text{ m}/\text{s} \\
        x(0) &= 10 \text{ m} \\
    \end{align*}
    \begin{align*}
        x''(t) &= -10 \\
        x'(t) &= \int -10 \ dt \\
        x'(t) &= -10t + c_1 \\
        x(t) &= \int -10t + c_1 \ dt \\
        x(t) &= -5t^2 + c_1t + c_2
    \end{align*}
    \begin{align*}
        x(0) &= -5(0)^2 + c_1(0) + c_2 \\
        10\text{ m} &= c_2
    \end{align*}
    \begin{align*}
        x'(0) &= -10(0) + c_1 \\
        0\text{ m/s} &= c_1
    \end{align*}
    \begin{align*}
        \therefore\ x(t) &= -5t^2 + 10 \\
        x'(2) &= -10(2) = -20 \text{ m/s}
    \end{align*}

    \section*{Separable Differential Equation}
    A separable first order differential equation has the following form.
    In separable differential equations, the variables can be separated and put
    on different sides of the equal sign, then integrated.
    \[
        \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)g(y)
    \]

    \subsection*{Example}
    \begin{align*}
        y' &= \frac{x}{y} \\
        \frac{dy}{dx} &= \frac{x}{y} \\
        y \frac{dy}{dx} &= x \\
        \int y \frac{dy}{dx} \ dx &= \int x \ dx \\
        \int y \ dy &= \int x \ dx \\
        \frac{1}{2} y^2 &= \frac{1}{2} x^2 + c \\
        y^2 &= x^2 + c
    \end{align*}

    \section*{Linear Differential Equations}
    A first order linear ode can be put in the following form.
    \begin{align*}
        y' + p(x)y = q(x) \\
        I(x)y' + I(x)P(x)y = I(x)Q(x) \\
    \end{align*}
    If we assume that this is a product rule,
    \begin{align*}
        \Big(I(x)y\Big)' = I(x)Q(x) \Rightarrow I(x)y' + I'(x)y = I(x)Q(x)
    \end{align*}
    This is almost in the form of the previous equation, just with the
    restriction
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{d}{dx} I(x) &= P(x)I(x) \\
        \frac{dy}{dx} &= P(x)y \\
        \frac{1}{y} dy &= P(x) dx \\
        \ln|y| &= \int P(x) \ dx \\
        I(x) &= Ae^{\int P(x) \ dx}
    \end{align*}
    Thus any linear differential equation can be converted to the derivative of
    the product of two functions $I(x)$, $Q(x)$

    \subsection*{Example}
    \begin{align*}
        xy' + 3y &= \frac{e^x}{x^2} \\
        y' + \frac{3}{x} y &= \frac{e^x}{x^3} \\
        P(x) &= \frac{3}{x} \\
        Q(x) &= \frac{e^x}{x^3} \\
        I(x) &= e^{\int \frac{3}{x} \ dx} \\
        &= e^{3\ln x} \\
        &= x^3 \\
        x^3y' + \frac{3}{x} x^3 y &= e^x \\
        x^3y' + 3x^2 y &= e^x \\
        (x^3y)' &= e^x \\
        x^3y &= e^x + c \\
        y &= \frac{e^x}{x^3} + \frac{c}{x^3}
    \end{align*}

    \subsection*{Example 2}
    $0 < x < \pi/2$
    \begin{align*}
        y' + \tan(x)y &= \sin(x) \\
        P(x) &= \tan(x) \\
        Q(x) &= \sin(x) \\
        I(x) &= e^{\int \tan(x) \ dx} \\
             &= e^{-\ln(\cos(x))} \\
             &= \sec x \\
        y'\sec x + (\sec x \tan x) y &= \sec x \sin x \\
        (y\sec x)' &= \tan x \\
        y\sec x &= \ln(\sec x) + c \\
        y &= \cos(x)\ln(\sec x) + c\cos(x)
    \end{align*}
